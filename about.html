    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Catstone was established in 2021, with the idea of being a platform to
      help preloved pets find new caring homes around the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the power of html, css and javascript, we can connect you with
      your adoptive pet and hopefully bring them in to your home as a new and
      grateful member of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      We at Catstone are 6 people who've come together to create this project
      and inject a little goodness back into the world!
    </p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>

    <h3>Michael</h3>

    <p>
      As a lifelong dog lover, Michael only learned to appreciate cats more
      recently. After reading online that cats don't like eye contact, he
      learned to look away to initiate cuddles. It works more often than not and
      he's happier now.
